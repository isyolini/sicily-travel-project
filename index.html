        <h3>SICILY CHARM</h3>
        <h2>One more tour, to love Sicily</h2>
        <p>
          Sicily's sunny, dry climate, scenery, cuisine, history, and
          architecture attract many tourists from the rest of Italy and abroad.
          The tourist season peaks in the summer months, although people visit
          the island all year round. Mount Etna, the beaches, the archaeological
          sites, and major cities such as Palermo, Catania, Syracuse and Ragusa
          are the favourite tourist destinations, but the old town of Taormina
          and the neighbouring seaside resort of Giardini Naxos draw visitors
          from all over the world, as do the Aeolian Islands, Erice, Terrasini,
          Castellammare del Golfo, Cefal√π, Agrigento, the Pelagie Islands and
          Capo d'Orlando. The last features some of the best-preserved temples
          of the ancient Greek period. Many Mediterranean cruise ships stop in
          Sicily, and many wine tourists also visit the island.

              and I am a half-Sicilian woman. My childhood was surrounded by the
              salty sea scent and the orange trees, while I was playing in my
              grandfather's orange grove. This project represents my roots and I
              would like to share with you my experience of travelling in this
              magical land.
